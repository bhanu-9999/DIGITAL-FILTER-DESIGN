# DESCRIPTION: 
  The Digital Filter Design block implements a digital Finite Impulse Response (FIR) or Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter that you design by using the Filter Designer (filterDesigner) app. This block provides the same filter implementation as the Discrete FIR Filter or Biquad Filter blocks. You must specify whether the block performs frame-based or sample-based processing on the input by setting the Input processing parameter. The block applies the specified filter to each channel of a discrete-time input signal and outputs the result. The outputs of the block numerically match the outputs of the Discrete FIR Filter or Biquad Filter block and the MATLAB® filter function. For more information, see Getting Started with Filter Designer. Discrete FIR Filter (Simulink) and Biquad Filter— Use to efficiently implement floating-point or fixed-point filters that you have already designed. These blocks provide the same exact filter implementation as the Digital Filter Design block. Filter Realization Wizard — Use to implement floating-point or fixed-point filters built from Sum, Gain, and Unit Delay blocks. You can either design the filter within this block, or import the coefficients of a filter that you designed elsewhere.
